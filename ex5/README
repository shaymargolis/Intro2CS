=   Function spliting   =
=========================

I will write for every function what custom functions
that I wrote are based on.

check_input_args:
    direction_valid:
        checks if a letter is a valid directoin

read_words_file + read_matrix_file:
    read_file_lines:
        returns array of file lines

find_words_in_matrix:
    - transform_matrix:
        Transform matrix from specific reading direction
        to left to right ('r' direction), using the following
        functions, that return the value in the original matrix
        for the new reading direction:
        - u_right_pos
        - l_right_pos
        - y_right_pos
    - find_word_in_matrix_right:
        Find the count that word appears in matrix when the
        reading direction is ('r')
    - get_dims:
        Returns the dimensions of a matix

=========================
=         Tests         =
=========================

I decided to test the function "find_word_in_matrix_right"

First test - word overlap should count as twice

Second test - should not stop after None

Third test - should search in all rows

Fourth test - Should not search beyond the given dims

Fifth test - should not start search for word
             if the len is beyond the dims

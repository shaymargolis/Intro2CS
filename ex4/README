I discussed the exercise with: .

=============================
=  README for ex4: Carrots  =
=============================


==================
=  Description:  =
==================

======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================

======================
=   Section C - q1   =
======================

The purpose of every test case:
1. Normal word, should expose the letter
2. Normal word but the request is to expose
    non existing letter, should not change
3. Empty pattern should not change
4. Empty pattern should expose the letters

======================
=   Section C - q2   =
======================

I wouldn't have to change any thing, because I didn't relay
on the type of the letters or on the transformation of them
to numbers! I used dict instead of the integer value of the word.
yay!

CHECK MAXIMUM:

The test function i wrote in check maximum test 6 different cases:
1. The array full with zeros - because zero is the minimal value
   and we want to see if it returns.
2. (3 different cases) the maximum is found in different indexes in the array.
3. The maximum is a float
4. The function should return None if the list is empty.


THEORETICAL QUESTIONS:

1. TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
   because the function runs len() function on the array
   but we give her a int.
2. It will return 0 because the function initializes first max=0
   and then searches for values higher than that, and since the input
   are all negative numbers they are less than 0.
3. TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int
   because we compare the array values to max and it is an error
   to compare int to str
4. [0, 1, 1] since it is an legal input.
5. empty set ([]) since 0 has no prime factors
6. [[0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]]
   it will return every pair a number of times since in the function
   itself we assumed that all the numbers appear only once,
   if they appear more than once then every number will be displayed
   several times.

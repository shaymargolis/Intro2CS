======================

1. is_prime

is_prime does command with constant time of operation O(1)
and then runs the function has_divisor_smaller_than(), that
runs O(n) times (from n-1 to 1), and each time does commands
with constant time. the total running time is O(n).

2. print_no_repetition_sequences

Let M be number of letters, n be length of string.
print_no_repetition_sequences uses the function
possible_no_repetition_sequences that returns array of all
possible sequences without repeat. in every step, it calculates
the concat for every letter (total M letters) with the possible
non repetition sequences.

so at every step i from 1 to n we make (M-i+1) calculations.

so the running time is:

T(M,N) = M! / (M-n)! = O(M^n)

3. flood_fill

At the worst case, flood_fill will fill the entire matrix
that is of a size NxM. that means that the function will run
n*m times, and that the running time is O(n*m)
